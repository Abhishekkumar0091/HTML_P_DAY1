    <h1>4.What is dns and when it come in picture</h1>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <h3>What is DNS?</h3>
    <p>
      DNS stands for Domain Name System. <br />
      It works like the phonebook of the internet. <br />
      Humans remember names like www.google.com, but computers work with IP
      addresses like 142.250.182.206. <br />
      DNS converts (resolves) domain names into IP addresses so your browser can
      connect to the right server.
    </p>
    <h3>When does DNS come in picture?</h3>
    <p>
      DNS comes into play when you type a website URL in your browser. <br />
      Example: You type www.google.com in Chrome. <br />
      Your computer asks the DNS server: <br />
      "What is the IP address of www.google.com ?" The DNS server replies with
      something like 142.250.182.206. <br />
      Your browser then uses this IP to connect to Google’s server and load the
      page.

    <h1>10.what does viewport meta tag do</h1>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>
      The viewport meta tag controls how a webpage is displayed on mobile
      devices. By default, web pages were designed for desktops, so when you
      open them on a phone, they might look zoomed out or tiny. The viewport
      meta tag tells the browser how to scale and size the page for the screen. <br>
      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"

    </p>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
