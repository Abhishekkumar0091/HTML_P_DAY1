    <h1>12.What is dns</h1>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>
      DNS stands for Domain Name System. <br />
      It is like the phonebook of the internet.
    </p>
    <h4>How DNS Works (Step by Step):</h4>
    <p>
      You type www.example.com in your browser. <br />

      Your computer asks the DNS server: "What is the IP address of this
      domain?"<br />

      The DNS server looks it up and replies with an IP address (e.g.,
      93.184.216.34). <br />

      Your browser then connects to that IP address and loads the website.
    </p>

    <h1>13. what is ip address</h1>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>
      IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number assigned to every device
      (computer, phone, server, etc.) on a network. It works like a home address
      for devices so they can send and receive data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Types of IP addresses: <br />

      1.IPv4 – 32-bit, looks like: <br />
      192.168.1.1 <br />
      2.IPv6 – 128-bit, created because IPv4 addresses are running out: <br />
      2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2
    </p>
